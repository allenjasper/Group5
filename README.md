Student Information Management System (SIMS)
📖 Project Description

This project is a simple Student Information Management System (SIMS) built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to:

Add a new student name to the list.

Remove the last student from the list.

Display all students.

Show the total count of students.

Show a student at a specific position (using at()).

Join all student names into a single string (using join()).

The system demonstrates JavaScript array methods (push(), pop(), length, at(), join()) as required in the assessment task.
